            <br>
            <p class="paragraph-information">The rally world was stunned by the little car. It could easily produce 550 horsepower thanks to its enormous back wing,
                all-wheel-drive system, and 4-cylinder engine. This World Rally Championship beast had a mid-ship engine and belonged to Group B. In 1985 and
                1986, the T16 machine was victorious. It may have continued to dominate the WRC if the Group B cars had not been banned. The vehicle stayed in
                motorsport after that, competing in the Paris-Dakar races until the late 1980s.</p>

            <h3 class="header-h3">What Does A Co-Pilot Do?</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph-information">In all of motoring, a co-driver is the most vital navigation system. It's impossible to memorize every turn of every route 
                in the rally, unlike racing circuits, when drivers memorize every corner and repeat the bends lap after lap. However, the stakes are significantly bigger
                than in road racing. Your car could be sliding down a mountainside if you slide on one turn. A fall like this might cause irreversible harm, not to mention 
                the possibility of injuries.   So, in the passenger seat, a co-driver directs the driver during the rally. The co-driver makes notes at each stage and informs
                the driver about the corner's direction, severity, and any straightaways in between bends..</p>

            <h3 class="header-h3">Can Fans Attend Rallys</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph-information">Yes! Fortunately, fans can attend World Rally Championship events to get up close and personal with the vehicles. Seeing people
                lining the track at what appears to be a perilous distance is not uncommon.  Tickets that guarantee entrance to specific stages of an event can be purchased.
                You'll watch one stage before joining the rally for the next one. This is usually a short walk or drive away, and following the pack on the road makes for an 
                interesting trip. Hospitality packages are also available, which include entrance to a lounge where you can meet other WRC fans.

            <p class="paragraph-information">This vehicle was developed by the Citroën team to compete in the World Rally Championship series. It perfectly replaced the Xsara
                on the track. The basis of this car was an ordinary hatchback. The Citroën C4 WRC is a modern legend. The greatest rally racer of all time, Sebastien Loeb,
                has sealed a crushing victory with this car from 2007 to 2010 and has won 13 asphalt rounds of the rally championship.</p>

                As every rally on the face of this earth should be doing is regarding the saftey of both drivers and bystanders. We have precaustions set just in

            <h3 class="header-h3">Why Do You Use Vintage Cars?</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph-information">
                Well... the reason why we use vintage cars is because we based our whole rally on Vintage rally club. The idea came about when the founder went through
                the garage and found alot of cars that were vintage and at cheap prices. Since he was a veteran of rallys he felt hurt to see such good horsepower go
                to waste. So he dedicated his idea to honor all the vintage cars and all the heros that drove them. Welcome to "VINTAGE" Rally Club lol.
